# explore-vs-exploit-gopniklab

Repository for Kai Hung's research project as part of UC Berkeley's SUPERB (EECS) REU in the summer of 2022. This project explores the trade-offs in exploration and exploitation within modern computational models and attempts to select a best fit model for children's learning process. Kai is mentored by Eunice Yiu for this project under Alison Gopnik's Cognitive Development and Learning Lab at UC Berkeley. 

## Instructions

Each script is self-contained and serve a different purpose in the exploration-modeling spectrum. 

* reinforcement_learning.ipynb - (Kai) contains the up-to-date RL models. This is the an active document. 
* simpleRL-version1.0.ipynb    - (Kai) contains the script for the first iteration of the RL model. This model is flawed and compute softmax probability with respect to the states only, the probability outputed is thus ambiguous in the context of the problem. 
* RL_Optimization_Test.ipynb   - (Kai) contains a script to diagnose performance of modeling functions.
* data_exploration.ipynb       - (Kai) a notebook used to perform exploratory analysis on the dataset. Much of the results from this is curated and condensed into the beginning of the modeling scripts, omitting the print statements and plots.
